# PingNachricht
PingNachricht is a simple and easy to use plugin, that manipulates the Hovermessage and playercount of the server.

## What is the hover-message?
The hovermessage is the message, that normally shows the current players on the server, when hovering with the
cursor over the playercount.
With the help of ProtocolLib does PingNachricht use this thing to its advantage, by creating *fake players*.
That way, the hovermessage can be modified to show a different type of message.

## What is the playercount?
The playercount is normally the thing that shows "x/x" (f.e. 3/20).
PingNachricht now uses that to show a custom message. That way you can make f.e. "Players: x/xx".
By using ProtocolLib to manipulate the "outdated server" message can we change the output of the playercounter.
But sadly will that cause your MC-client to think, that the server is outdated, which is the reason that
"outdated server" stands, where the ping-icon is.
